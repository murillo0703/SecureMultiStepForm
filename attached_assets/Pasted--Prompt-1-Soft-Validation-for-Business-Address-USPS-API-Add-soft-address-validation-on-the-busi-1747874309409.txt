🧭 Prompt 1: Soft Validation for Business Address (USPS API)
Add soft address validation on the business info page using the USPS Address Verification API.

When a user inputs a business address and moves focus out of the address field (on blur), call the USPS API.

If a correction or suggested format is returned, display a modal or inline prompt:
"Did you mean: 1234 Corrected St, Fresno, CA 93711?"

Allow the user to either accept the suggestion or keep their original.

Do not block submission — this is soft validation only.

🔧 Notes:

Use USPS Address Matching API or SmartyStreets API.

This must support edge cases like P.O. Boxes and Suite numbers.

🧭 Prompt 2: Phone Number Masking in Contact & Ownership Sections
Apply an input mask to all phone number fields in both:

Authorized Contact section

Business Ownership section

Format: XXX-XXX-XXXX (U.S. 10-digit only)

Prevent entry of non-numeric characters

Automatically insert dashes as the user types

🔧 Use libraries like react-input-mask or format handlers on onChange.

🧭 Prompt 3: Fix Error on Save from Contact Page to Employee Page
Fix the error when saving the Authorized Contact section:
“Failed to save contact. JSON: unexpected character at line 1 column 1 of JSON data”

Confirm that the frontend is properly encoding the contact form as valid JSON.

On submission, inspect the POST request to /api/companies/:companyId/contacts (or relevant route).

Ensure the server expects application/json and isn't receiving an empty string or malformed payload.

🔧 This likely means JSON.stringify(data) is missing or malformed — check the body before submission.

🧭 Prompt 4: Hide Employee Section Temporarily
Temporarily hide or disable the Employee section of the enrollment flow:

Do not show the “Employees” step in the progress bar or left nav

Do not allow navigation to /enrollment/employees

If manually visited, redirect to /enrollment/documents with a message like “This step will be available in a future version.”

🔧 Wrap the navigation and route in a feature flag (e.g., if (features.employeesEnabled)) for easier enablement later.

🧭 Prompt 5: Fix Document Upload UI to Allow Multiple Uploads
Fix the document upload behavior in the Documents section:

After uploading one document, the drop area disappears and cannot be used again unless you refresh or navigate away

The upload dropbox should remain visible after an upload, allowing users to upload additional documents without refreshing the page

Provide a button for uploading manually if needed

🔧 Likely caused by a state reset or conditional render(null) after file upload. Ensure component resets to “idle” state after successful upload.
