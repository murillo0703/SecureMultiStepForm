Give me the prompt we need to have it build out the broker and admin UI this way.  I am curious as to if this layout would benefit the application process as well.

Absolutely, Mo — here's your Replit prompt to build the modular UI layout using a left-hand table of contents (TOC) and dynamic main panel rendering, first for the Broker/Admin dashboard, but scalable to employer application flow if desired.

🧩 Replit Prompt – TOC + Main Panel UI Layout for Broker & Admin Interfaces
Build a reusable two-panel layout for the broker and admin dashboards using React and Tailwind CSS.
The layout should include a persistent left-hand navigation panel (table of contents) and a main content panel on the right that dynamically loads components based on user selection.

This layout will be reused across admin and broker flows and may later apply to the employer application wizard.

✅ 1. Layout Framework
Use a full-screen flex layout:

Left column: fixed width w-64, height 100vh

Right column: flexible flex-1 with scrollable content

tsx
Copy
Edit
<div className="flex min-h-screen">
  <Sidebar />
  <main className="flex-1 p-6 overflow-y-auto">
    {activeTab === "users" && <UserManagement />}
    {activeTab === "plans" && <PlanUpload />}
    ...
  </main>
</div>
✅ 2. Sidebar Component (Sidebar.tsx)
List all admin dashboard modules:

Dashboard Overview

User Management

Broker Accounts

Plan Uploads

PDF Templates

Audit Logs

Add onClick logic to update the activeTab in parent layout

Use icons (optional) and active highlight state

Use Tailwind styling: bg-white border-r h-full, highlight active tab

✅ 3. Main Panel Routing Logic
Store the current panel view in state (activeTab)

Show only the corresponding component in the right panel

You may use Wouter or internal state for routing

Optional: remember active tab using localStorage

✅ 4. Role-Specific Access
Render specific sidebar links based on user role:

admin: access all modules

brokerOwner: hide user management

staff: hide PDF mapping and plan uploads

✅ 5. Future Enhancement Hooks (Do not build yet)
Add breadcrumb header inside the main panel

Add responsive collapse of the sidebar on mobile/tablet

Add route-based navigation (e.g. /admin/pdf-templates)

Consider applying this layout style to the employer onboarding flow using section-based wizard instead of page-by-page routing

🔄 Reusing This Layout in the Employer Application Flow?
Yes — it’s a smart idea, especially if you want to:
Show application progress in the sidebar

Let users jump between sections (like “Company Info”, “Docs”, “Plans”)

Keep UI consistent between brokers and employers
