Build a complete Admin Control Center in the employer enrollment app.
This interface is for the app owner (Murillo Insurance Agency admin) to manage brokers, users, system activity, uploads, and form templates.

The following modules should be built into a single admin dashboard page (or a tabbed layout). Some modules may be hidden or disabled initially via features.json.

✅ 1. User Management
Display a table of all users with:

Email, role, associated broker agency, last login

Add admin controls for:

Resetting passwords

Editing user email addresses

Toggling access: active/inactive (suspension toggle)

Searching by email/name

Only super admins can access this section

✅ 2. Broker Account Status & Access
List all registered broker agencies with:

Agency name, logo, date created, user count

Current access status: enabled/disabled

Manual “flag for review” toggle
