You're reviewing an existing multi-step employer form app designed for onboarding and application submission.
This code already includes basic routing, some React form logic, and rudimentary progress tracking.
You are not rebuilding from scratch — you are auditing, correcting, and upgrading the current employer module for SaaS readiness.

Here’s what I want you to do:

🔍 1. Audit What’s Already Built
Identify which components in the Employer folder (or pages) already handle:

Company details

Ownership structure

Address and contact info

Signature steps

Application submission

Note areas where code is duplicated, not DRY, or missing form validation.

If the employer is marked as an owner, ensure their data prefills the ownership section without requiring reentry.

🛠 2. Fix Logic Bugs and Redundancy
Fix any places where:

State resets on page reload.

Date pickers default to wrong values (e.g. wrong month).

Progress bar doesn't update consistently.

Deduplicate repeated conditional JSX (e.g. ownership or entity-type checks).

Modularize form fields into reusable components.

🔐 3. Security + Save/Resume Logic
Implement secure local storage or DB save functionality:

When the employer fills in data, it's saved in real-time or when “Save” is clicked.

If they return, data is repopulated automatically.

Ensure that saved data cannot be accessed or submitted by others unless logged in or authenticated.

Add simple email + verification code login for employers to resume saved work.

🧾 4. File Upload + Final Submission
Fix or implement file upload logic:

Accept only PDF, JPG, PNG.

Enforce 5MB size cap.

Store uploaded docs securely (placeholder backend or Supabase preferred).

On final submission:

Show a review screen before submit.

Submit a complete packet via email to broker and admin.

Store a copy in broker dashboard + employer’s “submission history”.

📊 5. Dashboard + Resumable Quotes
Create a basic Employer Dashboard view:

List saved applications and quotes.

Allow user to resume unfinished applications.

Finalized quotes should be view-only.

Incomplete quotes expire after 12 months.

🎨 6. UI/UX Enhancements
Match layout to SaaS-grade 2-tier layout:

Left: Navigation menu (Quote / Application / History / Docs).

Right: Main form or content.

Use a top bar when multiple sub-sections exist (e.g. employee tabs).

Ensure all forms are mobile-friendly.

Highlight required fields and validation errors clearly.

✅ Final Deliverable
A fully audited and upgraded Employer Module:

Preserving all working logic

Eliminating code debt

Ready for multi-user SaaS use

Secure, saveable, resumable, and cleanly structured
